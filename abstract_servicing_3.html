                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this study was to develop an effective method of processing copper-contaminated sludge, produced during the manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs). In the first stage, 2 N sulfuric acid was used to leach the wet sludge. A solid to liquid ratio of approximately 1:10 was used. Because hydroxide compounds in the sludge were not stable when exposed to acid, the copper extraction percentage exceeded 85% in 15 min. In the second stage, an ammonia solution was used to purify the sulfuric acid leachate by forming an ammine complex. During this process hydroxide compounds were formed by the impurities (Al3+, Fe2+, Pb2+, etc.) in the leachate at pH 10. After purification, the residual metallic hydroxide compounds were treated by the ferrite process to produce a stable oxide compound. The ammine solution was then heated to evaporate the ammonia, and copper hydroxide was formed in solution. The temperature was maintained at 80° C by aeration. In the process, copper hydroxide was transformed into copper oxide. The copper concentration reached 98.4%. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2006.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article addresses the equilibrium for cadmium biosorption using olive stones as a sorbent material over a range of temperatures between 25 and 80° C. Three models frequently used in the literature—Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson—were examined to describe these equilibrium data. The experimental results fit Langmuir's model for the majority of temperatures tested. The maximal biosorption capacity, qm, increases with temperature, rising from 4.52 mg/g at 25° C to 9.72 mg/g at 80° C. Also, the affinity of olive stones for cadmium, represented by parameter b in Langmuir's model, increases when the temperature is raised from 25 to 80° C. Finally, the shape of Langmuir's model, represented by the dimensionless parameter KR, shows that cadmium biosorption with olive stones works well at the temperatures and initial cadmium concentrations tested in this study. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2006.</p>

                <h3 title="Two Novel Applications of Ion Exchange Fibers: Arsenic Removal and Chemical-Free Softening of Hard Water ">&nbsp;3.Two Novel Applications of Ion Exchange Fibers: Arsenic Removal and Chemical-Free Softening of Hard Water </h3>
                
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation processes using ion exchange materials are ubiquitous regarding the selective removal of contaminants of environmental concern. Recently, highly regulated contaminants, such as arsenic, have gained notoriety on account of carcinogenic effects and subsequent promulgation of new drinking water standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Other nonregulated compounds such as hardness (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+), pose a particular concern to avoid scaling in heat-transfer equipment, foulingz in membranes, and high consumption of detergents and sequestering chemicals in cooling and wash water. In general, ion exchange processes used to remove hardness generate concentrated brine or mineral acid as a waste regenerant stream. Residuals management and long-term sustainability issues will continue to be major concerns with these processes. The subject paper reports and discusses the results and attributes of two new separation processes using ion exchange fibers (IX-fibers). The first process involves the selective removal of arsenic using hybridized IX-fibers that contain dispersed hydrated ferric oxide (HFO) nanoparticles. Anion-exchanger-supported HFO particles offered a high arsenic removal capacity; less than 10% of influent arsenic broke through after 30,000 bed volumes. Hybrid fibers were also amenable to efficient regeneration with 2% NaOH and 2% NaCl and capable of simultaneous removal of both arsenic(V) and arsenic(III). The second process involves the environmentally benign removal of hardness. Most importantly, this process uses harvested snowmelt (or rainwater) sparged with carbon dioxide as the regenerant. Consequently, the spent regenerant does not contain a high concentration of aggressive chemicals such as sodium chloride or acid like traditional ion-exchange processes nor does the process produce voluminous sludges as does lime softening. The bulk of carbon dioxide consumed during regeneration remains sequestered in the aqueous phase as alkalinity. For both treatment strategies, IX-fibers form the heart of the process. They are essentially thin cylindrical polymeric strands 10–20 μm in diameter with functional groups residing near to the fiber surface. Low intraparticle diffusional resistance is the underlying reason why calcium loaded weak acid IX-fibers are amenable to efficient regeneration using either snowmelt or rainwater sparged with carbon dioxide. Additionally, for hybrid IX-fibers, enhanced adsorption kinetics may offer the possibility for certain point of use applications, which are unavailable to their resin counterparts. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2006.</p>

                <h3 title="TREATMENT OF HIGHLY POLLUTED GROUNDWATER BY NOVEL IRON REMOVAL PROCESS ">&nbsp;4.TREATMENT OF HIGHLY POLLUTED GROUNDWATER BY NOVEL IRON REMOVAL PROCESS </h3>
                
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) in groundwater has been generally achieved by simple aeration, or the addition of an oxidizing agent. Aeration has been shown to be very efficient in insolubilization ferrous iron at a pH level greater than 6.5. In this study, pH was maintained over 6.5 using limestone granules under constant aeration to oxidize ferrous iron in groundwater in a limestone packed column. A sedimentation unit coupled with a membrane filtration was also developed to precipitate and filtrate the oxidized ferric compound simultaneously. Several bench-scale studies, including the effects of the limestone granule sizes, amounts and hydraulic retention time on iron removal in the limestone packed column were investigated. It was found that 550 g/L of the 7–8 mesh size limestone granules, and 20 min of hydraulic retention time in the limestone packed column, were necessary for the sufficient oxidation of 40 mg/L of iron(II) in groundwater. Long-term operation was successfully achieved in contaminated waters by removing the iron deposits on the surface of the limestone granule by continuous aeration from the bottom of the column. Periodic reverse flow helped to remove caking and fouling of membrane surface caused by the continuous filtration. Recycling of the treated water from the membrane right after reverse flow operation made possible an admissible limit of iron concentration of the treated water for drinking.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Industrial solid waste, Fe(III)/Cr(III) hydroxide, was investigated to assess the capacity for the removal of phosphate from aqueous solution. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were used to model the adsorption equilibrium data. The system follows both isotherms. Adsorption capacity was found to be 6.5 mg/g. Kinetic studies show that the adsorption obeyed second order kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters were evaluated. Overall adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Optimum pH for phosphate adsorption was found to be 4.0. Effect of coexisting anions has also been examined.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This work reports a study of the extraction and recovery of chromium from the wastes (class I dangerous) generated by a galvanic manufacturer. Commercial HCl at room temperature was employed, and the conditions of the extraction process were optimized according to a sequential experimental design, which also included the acid concentration and contact time as variables. The best extraction conditions (80% v/v; 30 min; 97.6% Cr) for the chromic sludge were chosen in order to make the recovery process economically feasible. After each extraction, the residue was submitted to leaching essays, to assess environmental risks. It was found that sludge could be characterized as no longer dangerous. In the recovery study, a simple and low-cost technique was evaluated for selectivity based on an oxidation step with hydrogen peroxide. A 23 factorial design to assess the inﬂuence of oxidation time (min), temperature (◦C) and peroxide amount (mol/L) was employed. The best conditions, yielding a chromium recovery of about 92%, were a time of 60 min, a temperature of 60◦C and 2.1 mol/L peroxide. Additional essays revealed that the same result could be obtained with more economic conditions (40 min, 1.4 mol/L peroxide and 60◦C). This technique proved not only effective in comparison with existing alternatives, but also low costing.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This study investigated and analyzed the effects of the heating temperature on the properties of the sintered sewage sludge ash. The results indicated that the water absorption rate of the sintered sewage sludge ash samples decreased when the ﬁring temperature was increased from 800 to 900◦C. When the heating temperature reached 1000◦C, the absorption rate decreased signiﬁcantly. The bulk density of the sewage sludge ash samples increased by 2.3 g/cm3 when the heating temperature was increased from 900 to 1000◦C, indicating that the densiﬁcation was affected by heating. The porosity of the sintered sewage sludge ash samples ranged from 36% to 39% when the heating temperature ranged from 600 to 900◦C. The least porosity occurred at 1000◦C; the sintered samples were well densiﬁed. When the temperature was between 900 and 1000◦C, the strength appeared to increase signiﬁcantly, reaching 2040 kgf/cm2, implying an advance in densiﬁcation due to sintering. The SEM observations were in general agreement with the trends shown by the density data.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A method was used to investigate the potential for using water clariﬁer sludge to remove copper in a ﬂuidized-bed reactor (FBR). This study was conducted to evaluate the removal of copper in an aquatic system without prior treatment. Chemical analyses of water clariﬁer sludge through inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometry indicated that silicon, aluminum and iron oxides made up more than 84% of this average composition, similar to the composition of clay. The experimental results indicated that the copper removal efﬁciency was highly dependent on the pH. pH values also inﬂuence the character of the water clariﬁer sludge. After the copper was adsorbed by the water clariﬁer sludge, the pH of the solution was slightly increased. In the FBR, the copper removal efﬁciency reached 90% when the initial copper concentration was 20 mg/L, the pH was 4 and the operating time was 60 min. In addition, copper precipitation occured on the surface of clariﬁer sludge when the initial copper concentration was 20 mg/L and the pH was 7.0. The kinetics of copper ion adsorption at pH 5 showed that 94% copper ion was removed in 60 min and the adsorption equilibrium was attained in 5 h. The mechanisms of adsorption of copper ions on water clariﬁer sludge including the formation of surface complexation and surface precipitate.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Batch experiments were carried out to study the kinetics and efﬁciency of inorganic arsenic removal by zero valent iron (ZVI) powder, and as well as the effects of pH, anions, and humic material (HM) on this process. Moreover, column experiment was conducted for 31 days to treat arsenate solution of 500g As/L using waste iron chippings as ﬁlling. Batch experiments showed that both arsenate and arsenite compounds could be removed efﬁciently from simulated groundwater by ZVI under aerobic and relative anaerobic conditions. Aerobic condition was favorable to arsenic removal especially for arsenate, while arsenite could be removed more rapidly than arsenate in relative anaerobic condition. Oxidation of arsenite to arsenate by iron species in aerobic environment was observed, which is thought to be an important pathway of arsenite removal. In an unsealed system, the removal efﬁciency of both arsenate and arsenite decreased at higher pH value. In a sealed system, acidic and alkaline condition seemed to be favorable for arsenate and arsenite removal, respectively. Phosphate and low concentration sulfate caused a decrease in arsenate removal, while high concentration sulfate as well as nitrate caused slight increase in arsenate removal. Presence of HM in solution slightly inhibited arsenic removal. Arsenic removal efﬁciency in column study was inﬂuenced by ﬂow rate and work period of the column. More than 98% of arsenate could be removed stably with a hydraulic resident time of 2 h at last, and the efﬂuent meet the drinking water standard.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While different kinds of compost have been tested for highway revegetation, sewage sludge has only been used for agricultural purposes. In this work, its application for helping vegetation establishment on roads embankments is studied. Testing areas measuring 4×5 m were constructed on a new highway embankment in an arid location. Several variables are analyzed: side slope (2); sludge dosage (4); vegetative species (4). Results are presented on growth, survival rate and germination of the plants; colonization of other species; cover crop for the plots; estimation of the erosion. The species planted manually showed satisfactory results although any variable was specially signiﬁcant in this case. However, in relation to the species planted using hydroseeding, 2:1 side slope presented better results than 3:2 side slope. Using hydroseeding, the performance of different species was signiﬁcantly different, thyme did not grow if sludge was not applied and the cover crop was higher in plots with 3:2 side slope than in plots with 2:1 side slope, essentially due to the presence of colonizing species. Finally, the costs of the proposed treatments are ﬁgured out, being concluded that, so much from the technical as the economic point of view, it is a viable proposal for sewage sludge management.</p>

Limited Acid Demand (LAD) was examined in order to avoid the co-dissolution of undesirable constituents. The Separation Factor (SF), which is the concentration ratio of dissolved constituents in the resulting leaching solution after the application of extraction stage, can describe the selective release of lead against iron, according to the variation of major leaching parameters (i.e. the molarity of used acid and the liquid to solid (L/S) ratio). A general equation, describing the overall leaching process was obtained, containing a speciﬁc “inhibition constant” and indicating that when the initial stoichiometry of leaching procedure and the applied L/S ratio are known, then the removal of lead can be predicted</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solvent extraction is an effective way to treat and recover the phenolic compounds from the high content phenolic wastewater at present. The experimental study on treating the wastewater containing phenol has been carried out with QH-1extractant (the amine mixture) and annular centrifugal contactors. The distribution ratio of phenol was 108.6 for QH-1–phenol system. The mass-transfer process of phenol for the system was mainly controlled by diffusion. When the ﬂow ratio (aqueous/organic) was changed from 1/1 to 4/1, the rotor speed was changed from 2500 to 4000 r/min, and the total ﬂow of two phases was changed from 20 to 70 mL/min, the mass-transfer efﬁciency E of the single-stage centrifugal contactor was more than 95%. When the ﬂow ratio was changed from 4.4/1 to 4.9/1, the rotor speed was 3000 r/min, and the total ﬂow of two phases was changed from 43.0 to 47.0 mL/min, the extraction rate ρ of the three-stage cascade was more than 99%. When 15% NaOH was used for stripping of phenol in QH-1, the stripping efﬁciency of the three-stage cascade was also more than 99% under the experimental condition</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorption of lead and cadmium from aqueous solutions by grape stalk waste (a by-product of wine production) was investigated. The effects of the contact time, pH of the solution, ionic medium, initial metal concentration, other metal ions present and ligands were studied in batch experiments at 20◦C. Maximum sorption for both metals was found to occur at an initial pH of around 5.5. The equilibrium process was described well by the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximum grape stalk sorption capacities of 0.241 and 0.248 mmol g−1 for Pb(II) and Cd(II), respectively, at pH around 5.5. Kinetic studies showed good correlation coefﬁcients for a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The presence of NaCl and NaClO4 in the solution caused a reduction in Pb and Cd sorption, the latter being more strongly suppressed. The presence of other metals in the uptake process did not affect the removal of Pb, while the Cd uptake was much reduced. HCl or EDTA solutions were able to desorb lead from the grape stalks completely, while an approximately 65% desorption yield was obtained for cadmium. From the results obtained it seems that other mechanisms, such as surface complexation and electrostatic interactions, must be involved in the metal sorption in addition to ion exchange.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unextracted residue obtained after a countercurrent two-step extractive process of silica from pumice lapillus, at 100◦C and room pressure, has been found mainly crystallized to the pseudo-cubic form typical of zeolite P. This residue could be active as a low-cost agent for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater. In this paper the removal capacity of six metallic cations (i.e. Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ and Cr3+) was studied in a stirred batch reactor. Results obtained showed that the removal of metal ions (100–500 mg g−1) from wastewater is achieved in a short time and the concentration lowered under the legal limits. The adsorption mechanism mainly involves an ionic exchange between sodium ions from the solid phase and heavy metals in solution. However, if wastewater was accompanied by free acidity, it ﬁrst should be neutralized to pH 4–5 to prevent zeolite destruction.</p>

The parameters coded as x1, x2 and x3, consecutively, were used. The parameters were investigated at two levels (−1 and 1). The effects of these factors on dependent variables, namely, % E and pHeq were investigated. To determine the signiﬁcance of effects, the analysis of variance with 95% conﬁdence limits was used. It was shown that % E and pHeq obtained in this study were found to be 99.6% and 11.16, corresponding to the operating condition of 25 mg l−1,2gl−1 and 5.5 for the phosphate concentration, ﬂy ash dosage and pH0, respectively.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MAPPE GIS based multimedia model is used to produce a quantitative description of the behaviour of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) in Europe, with emphasis on continental surface waters. The model is found to reasonably reproduce γ-HCH distributions and variations along the years in atmosphere and soil; for continental surface waters, concentrations were reasonably well predicted for year 1995, when lindane was still used in agriculture, while for 2005, assuming severe restrictions in use, yields to substantial underestimation. Much better results were yielded when same mode of release as in 1995 was considered, supporting the conjecture that for γ-HCH, emission data rather that model structure and parameterization can be responsible for wrong estimation of concentrations. Future research should be directed to improve the quality of emission data. Joint interpretation of monitoring and modelling results, highlight that lindane emissions in Europe, despite the marked decreasing trend, persist beyond the provisions of existing legislation.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sediments from a remote lake of northeastern Tibetan Plateau were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace metals. USEPA priority PAHs, ranged from 11 in 1860 to 279 ng g−1 in 2002, while, the deposition fluxes were in the range of 0.2–11.4 ng cm−2 yr−1. Similarly, from 1860 to 2002, an increased trend of Hg flux was observed (0.5–3.2 ng cm−2 yr−1). Remarkable increase of PAHs and Hg concentration began from 1970, nearly the same period of the “Reform and Open” Policy had been embarked (1978) in China. Good correlations were found between concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Hg, and PAHs, which suggested the sources of these chemicals in the sediment is analogous, likely from anthroprogenic sources. Based on isomer ratios, PAHs in core were dominantly from the incomplete combustion of coal. Owing to the proximity to dust source area (Qaidam Basin) and the close association between PAHs, Hg, Pb, and particle matters, atmospheric dust-transport and deposition might be the main pathways that pollutants enter into Qinghai Lake.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A new type of process for producing high-purity calcium carbonate from waste cement powder was developed. The process consists of two main reactions; extraction of calcium in the form of calcium ions from waste cement powder in a water slurry by pressurized CO2(typically at several MPa), and precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from the extracted solution by reduction of the CO2 pressure. The process can be recognized as the emission reduction process of CO2 as well. Laboratory-scale experimental studies were conducted for both the extraction reaction and the precipitation reaction, to examine the feasibility of the process. The extraction process was found to proceed at a relatively high rate, especially during the initial 10 min. The concentration of calcium ions exceeded the thermodynamic solubility of CaCO3 (supersaturation) when abundant waste cement was available. After filtration of the residues, CaCO3particles with >98% purity were obtained by depressurizing the CO2. The dependency of the reaction rates on the operating conditions, such as the ratio of waste cement to water, CO2 pressure, and particle size of waste cement particles, was investigated. A process design was carried out based on the experimental results, assuming that the present process is applied to two types of CaCO3 production process: flue gas desulfurization and production of ultrahigh-purity CaCO3. The estimated costs per 1 metric ton of CaCO3 were USD 136 for desulfurization and USD 323 for high-purity CaCO3. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog,</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A number of regulatory actions focused on reducing NOx emissions from stationary combustion sources have been taken in the United States in the last decade. These actions include the Acid Rain NOx regulations, the Ozone Transport Commission's NOx Budget Program, and the NOx SIP Call rulemakings. In addition to these regulations, the recent Interstate Air Quality Rulemaking proposal and other bills in the Congress are focusing on additional reductions of NOx. Industrial combustion sources accounted for about 18% of NOx emissions in the United States in 2000 and constituted the second largest emitting source category within stationary sources, only behind electric utility sources. Based on these data, reduction of NOx emissions from industrial combustion sources is an important consideration in efforts undertaken to address the environmental concerns associated with NOx. This paper discusses primary and secondary NOx control technologies applicable to various major categories of industrial sources. The sources considered in this paper include large boilers, furnaces and fired heaters, combustion turbines, large IC engines, and cement kilns. For each source category considered in this paper, primary NOx controls are discussed first, followed by a discussion of secondary NOx controls. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2005.</p>
