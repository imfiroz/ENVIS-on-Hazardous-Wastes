                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coking wastewater contains high a concentration of refractory and toxic compounds to be treated before being discharged into the environment. The water quality usually cannot meet the discharge limits after conventional biological treatment processes. This article initially investigated the treatability of coking wastewater with conventional and modified Fenton processes for advanced treatment of coking wastewater. Based on the experimental results, up to 86% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 99.5% of phenol removals were achieved by the conventional Fenton process at original pH 7.8 within 60 min. pH adjustment was not performed due to the sudden drop in the original pH value, after the addition of Fenton's reagents. A modified Fenton process yielded comparable COD (82%) and phenol (98.5%) removals within 120 min at pH 3.0. The optimal operating conditions were determined as [Fe2+] = 300 mg/L, [H2O2] = 4000 mg/L, and pH = 7.8 for a conventional Fenton process, and [Fe0] = 300 mg/L, [H2O2] = 4500 mg/L, and pH = 3 for a modified Fenton process. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 176-180, 2013.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of nesquehonite and calcium carbonate using low-grade magnesite as a starting material, as well as the chemical treatment of copper-bearing heavy metal wastewater by using nesquehonite as a novel precipitating agent was investigated for the first time. The precipitation of copper with nesquehonite was shown to be successful in reducing the level of soluble copper in solution. The precipitation completion being reached within 30 min. The removal efficiency of copper was not affected by the addition of nesquehonite and a removal efficiency up to 99.97% was achieved as excess coefficient of nesquehonite was 0%. At this time, the precipitated amount of copper by nesquehonite was 459 mg/g. The residual copper concentration was 0.1 mg/L, and final pH value was 6.8, which met the Chinese discharge limit (0.5–2.0 mg/L, GB8978-1996) and the USEPA enforceable limit of 0.25 mg/L. The precipitate produced was very rich in copper, which occurred in the form of Cu(OH)2, CuCO3, Cu2(OH)2CO3, Cu3(OH)2(CO3)2, and Cu4(OH)6SO4•H2O. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 543–546, 2013.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activated carbons derived from municipal sewage sludge with pyrolusite modification were prepared. The impact of pyrolusite amount on the activated carbons' characteristics was evaluated by methylene blue tests. The results showed that activated carbons modified with certain amount of pyrolusite (ACP) had better performance than the ones without pyrolusite addition. These activated carbons prepared were effective in COD and color removal in treating an industrial dyeing wastewater. The significant increase of mesopores in the adsorbents was identified as the reason. The optimum pH value for dye adsorption was pH = 3.0 and it took a relatively long contact time to reach equilibrium (≥8 h). Temperature had no obvious effect on dye removal in this study. The regeneration efficiency for three ACPs after two adsorption/regeneration cycles was above 70%. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2011.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removal of nitrate from drinking water by a coupling of methanol-based electrochemical hydrogen and carbon dioxide generator and a packed-bed bioreactor was investigated. The major goal was to study the performance of this integrated system for simultaneous, economical, in situ, and on-demand electron donor and carbon source production for hydrogenotrophic denitrification of drinking water in actual scales. The ability of system has been evaluated for treatment of natural underground water up to 120 mg NO3−/L (threefold of the drinking water limit) nitrate concentration. Removal efficiencies above 95% were achieved for more than 150 days of operation at a 2–5 h retention time. Furthermore, the system was operated only by injection of two harmless gases (produced by electrolysis of methanol) and without any chemical addition (solid or liquid). In the electrolysis process, H2 and CO2 (H2 as an electron donor and CO2 as a carbon source for denitrifier bacteria) was produced cheaply and simultaneously by applying a very low DC voltage (4–6 V) to a solution that includes an easily oxidizable organic substance (methanol) and electrolyte solution comprised water and a base. In situ and under control generation of H2 and CO2 by an efficient, cost-effective way showed that this process can be an acceptable and reliable system for treatment of nitrate contaminated drinking water in actual scales. Additionally, convenient process operation without need of high pressure and explosive gas cylinders and only by voltage adjustment is other advantage of the process. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2010.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column studies were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of tertiary treatment of paper and pulp mill effluent through mono and mixed columns (different grades) of vermiculite. It was found that maximum sodium percentage removal was 50% in mixed columns (RVG2 + RVG3) whereas the mono columns was less efficient in removing to the tune of 35.2% of Na in RVG2. Incase of retention of sodium and removal of color it followed a general trend where, maximum adsorption was noticed at the first pore volume and it followed a linear decreasing trend during the second pore volume whereas in the third pore volume it was almost static and there was only a meager adsorption in Na and color. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2008.</p>

                <h3 title="Bioethanol from agricultural waste residues ">&nbsp;2.Bioethanol from agricultural waste residues </h3>
                
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Government of Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Ethanol-blended gasolines have the potential to contribute significantly to these emission reductions. Ethanol is derived from biologically renewable resources and can be employed to replace octane enhancers and aromatic hydrocarbons or oxygenates. To date, the ethanol production industry in Canada is comprised mainly of small-scale plants producing ethanol primarily from agricultural crops as feedstock. Research interests in the area of bioethanol production from organic waste materials emerged in the late 1980. Significant advances in lignocellulosic material extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis have been reported in the last decade, however, continued research efforts are essential for the development of technically feasible and economically viable large-scale enzyme-based biomass-to-ethanol conversion processes. This research aims to develop and test an enzyme-based biomass-to-ethanol conversion process, which employs organic waste materials, such as livestock manures, as alternative sources of cellulosic material feedstock. The source of the livestock manure, manure management practices and cellulose extraction procedures have a significant impact on the quantity and quality of the cellulosic materials derived. As such, raw feedstock materials must be carefully characterized to assess the impact of these factors on the yield of bioethanol and residual end products. The success of cellulose-to-ethanol conversion processes for cellulose extracted from these waste materials as feedstock is generally a function of cellulose fiber pretreatment, enzyme selection and operating conditions. These will differ depending on the source of the waste material feedstock. The long-term benefits of this research will be to introduce a sustainable solid waste management strategy for a number of livestock manure and other lignocellulosic waste materials; contribute to the mitigation in greenhouse gases through sustained carbon and nutrient recycling; reduce the potential for water, air, and soil contamination associated with land disposal of organic waste materials; and to broaden the feedstock source of raw materials for the ethanol production industry. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2008</p>
