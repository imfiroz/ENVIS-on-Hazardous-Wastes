                    <p><b>Application of the waste shipments regulation and recommendatory guidance for ship owners:</b></p>
                    	<br>
                    	<ul>
                        	<li> <p>The strategy sets out the relevant waste controls applicable to the export of UK-flagged end-of-life vessels for recycling from UK ports, and provides recommendatory guidance for ship owners.</p></li>
                            <li> <p>The EC Waste Shipments Regulation (WSR) implements the Basel Convention in the EU and covers the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the EU. The WSR provides detailed rules for the control of transboundary movements of waste, the central aspect of these being a notification procedure involving the competent authorities of dispatch, transit and destination.</p></li>
                            <li> <p>The WSR defines waste in accordance with article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive11 which states: ‘waste’ shall mean any substance or object…which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard. Where a UK-flagged vessel is being exported from a UK port for recycling, it is likely to fall within the definition of waste and thus be subject to the EC WSR12. Recital 35 of the revised Waste Shipments Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, notes that a ship may become waste as defined in Article 2 of the Basel Convention and that at the same time it may be defined as a ship under other international rules.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <br>
                     <p><b>Thus, in the absence of any internationally recognized mandatory regime for end-of-life vessels, Government expects:</b></p>
                     	<br>
                    	<ul>
                        	<li> <p>Where an end-of-life vessel falls within the definition of waste, as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, controls under the EC Waste Shipments Regulation will apply.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Any imports of vessels for the purposes of recycling to be notified in accordance with the provisions of the Waste Shipments Regulation or existing international rules (under the Basel Convention and/or OECD Decision13) as appropriate.</p></li>
                            <li> <p>Any exports of UK-flagged vessels from a UK port for the purposes of recycling to be notified in accordance with the provisions of the Waste Shipments Regulation.</p></li>
                            <li> <p>The WSR implements the Basel Convention’s Decisions II/12 and III/1, known as the ‘Basel ban’, whereby exports of all hazardous wastes to non-OECD countries are prohibited. Given the range of hazardous materials found in end-of-life vessels, it is likely that an end-of-life vessel would be classified as hazardous. In practice, this means that they may only be exported to OECD countries.</p></li>
                            <li> <p>Government recommends that ship owners make reference to the IMO Guidelines at all stages when a ship is sold for recycling, paying particular attention to the following elements:</p>

                                	<li> <p>Design of ships and ships’ equipment to facilitate recycling</p></li>
                                    <li> <p>Inventory of hazardous materials onboard and preparation of a Green Passport (for new builds and existing ships)</p> </li>
                                    <li> <p>Selection of an acceptable recycling facility </p></li>
                                    <li> <p>Preparation of a Ship Recycling Plan</p></li>

                             <li> <p>Ship owners are encouraged to review their current ship recycling practices in line with this strategy in preparation for the introduction of the new International Convention on the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships</p></li>
